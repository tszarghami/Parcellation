# DCM Parcellation

This is a demo for the parcellation of a dynamic causal model of the brain, based on the attention-to-visual-motion dataset.

Run DEMO codes in the Code folder. DCMs are included in the Data folder.

DEMO1 should take less than 10 minutes to run, DEMO2 less than 5 minutes. Plots will be saved in Results folder.

DEMO1 uses minimal #permutations to save computation time. Before applying to other DCMs, increase NPerm.

The code has dependencies on SPM12, CSCbox and BCT toolboxes. Light versions of CSCbox and BCT are already included.
SPM can be downloaded from:
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/ OR https://github.com/spm/spm12.
